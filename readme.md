# the simulation of tribometer test

## 1.	Introduction

This study simulates the frictional behavior of a tribological conjunction lubricated with nanometer-thick perfluoropolyether (PFPE) lubricant. In the simulation, a magnetic disk, composing of glass substrate, magnetic layer and 3 nm thick diamond-like carbon overcoat, is rotated against a BK-7 glass pin with spherical end cap of 7.5 mm radius. The initial supplied lubricant, hini along this sliding contact consists of 1.7 nm thick non-polar Z03 type PFPE lubricant. The simulated tribological conjunction is illustrated in following figure.
